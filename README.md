## Notes

My main challenge was navigating Xcode and understanding how to work with SwiftUI/UIKit. The interface felt overwhelming at first, and setting up Auto Layout for responsiveness took trial and error.

I also struggled with integrating backend functionality, handling API calls, and managing real-time updates smoothly. Despite these challenges, I gained a better understanding of Xcode’s workflow and improved my coding efficiency.
